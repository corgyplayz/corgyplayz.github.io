    <td>I learnt by listening and paying attention to the teacher when he was speaking. I asked no questions in the whole lesson whereas in previous lessons we asked more questions. We also got lots done as some groups did not get past where we got to.Therefore we did well and don't need to rush next week.</td>

    <td>I could help more because my partners did a bit more than me whereas last week, we did the same amount. This week we did not get as much progress as last week but we still are ahead of others.</td>

    <td>I need to help a bit more and also read the sheet better because me and my partners spent lots of time on one question when we only had to do something little that was on the sheet in front of us.</td>
