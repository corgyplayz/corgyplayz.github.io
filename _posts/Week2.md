    <td>Today we worked on Raspberry Pi, which is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. We did basic coding with partners, but I worked in a three, and got up to page 25 in the booklet about it, showing what code to do.</td>
