    <td>I learnt by listening and paying attention to the teacher when he was speaking. I asked no questions in the whole lesson whereas in previous lessons we asked more questions. We did very well as only one group we know of got to where we are now so we are ahead of the average.</td>

    <td>I did do more this week than previous weeks so I need to do more next weeks as I can do it to the standard of others in my group I'm just a bit slower. This means I'm improving.</td>
