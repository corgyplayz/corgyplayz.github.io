    <td>I learnt by listening and paying attention Mr Keen when he was speaking. I also only asked one question in the lesson and that was because our group did not have it written on the booklet. We also got lots done as some groups did not get past where we got to. This shows that we work well together and get the work done.</td>

    <td>I need to do more or try things out more before asking questions because I asked a question once where the answer was just to save it, this shows that it was a question that was not needed because the answer was very simple.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be more independent in the future and ask less questions. I will also need to follow instructions better because I asked some stupid questions that the answers were obvious or were on the sheet.</td>
